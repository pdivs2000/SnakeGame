# Snake Game

## Overview
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Snake game in C++.

## Features

- Collect fruits to increase your score.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- Press `k` to quit the game.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11)
- Windows operating system (for Windows-specific functionality)

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file generated.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
5. Collect fruits to increase your score.
6. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
7. Press `k` to quit the game.

## Build Instructions
If you're using CMake, follow these steps to build the game:
1. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
2. Navigate into the build directory: `cd build`
3. Generate build files with CMake: `cmake ..`
